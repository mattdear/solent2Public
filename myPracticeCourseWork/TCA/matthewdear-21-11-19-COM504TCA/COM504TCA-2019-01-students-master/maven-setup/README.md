install maven

You will also need to install Netbeans 8.2 (not 9.0) (Ideally you should install the Jave EE version)
https://netbeans.org/


## Working on class pc's

The class PC's should have Netbeans 8.2 already installed.

The class PC's have JDK 8 installed but do not have the java JDK class path correctly set up so you cannot call javac from the command line. 
Unfortunately by default the class PC's also do not have apache maven installed. 

We need access to the JDK and maven for this class, so I have provided a script to help.
This script will download a copy of maven to the maven directory and include it with the java JDK on your class path.

Open a windows command prompt in the maven-setup directory and run the batch file.

```
cd maven-setup
maven-script.bat
```
If maven is not already downloaded, this script will download and unpack it and include it in the class path.

To check it has worked type 
```
mvn -version
```
also type 
```
javac -version
```
For all of the class exercises you will need to open a command prompt and run this script first. 
Then use this command window to run the exercises. (i.e. run the script in this folder and then cd to the folder where you are doing the exercise).

# Using Powershell
if you are usign powershell instead of cmd.exe, the maven-script.bat doesn't change the environment after it completes.

In this case use the following command which will leave the environment variables changed
```
 .\Invoke-CmdScript maven-script.bat

```
Again to check it has worked type 
```
mvn -version
```
also type 
```
javac -version
```
